    	    <p>In the near term, quantum computer designers hope to build machines that are sophisticated and stable enough to do useful tasks that traditional computers can’t do. Some researchers expect these “noisy intermediate-scale” quantum computers to excel at simulation; others are skeptical. Current quantum computers are being used mainly to explore certain physics, chemistry and mathematical problems and as test beds to understand how to make more powerful quantum computers.</p>
            <p>For other tasks, such as running Shor’s code-breaking algorithm, a quantum computer may need millions of qubits that can run error-free indefinitely, like our classical computers do. Such a quantum computer is probably still much further away. </p>
            <p>Many experts believe that because they are so complex and delicate, quantum computers will probably never sit on or desks or in our pockets. Rather, they may live inside commercial computing centers, national labs and universities, where they will crunch quantum information and deliver solutions that make our world smarter, safer and more efficient</p>
